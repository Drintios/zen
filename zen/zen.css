/*
 * ZEN STYLES
 *
 * This is an example stylesheet. Sub-themes should NOT include the zen/zen.css
 * file, but instead copy this CSS to their own stylesheets.
 *
 * In this stylesheet, we have included all of the classes and IDs from this
 * theme's tpl.php files. We have also included many of the useful Drupal core
 * styles to make it easier for theme developers to see them.
 *
 * Many of these styles are over-riding Drupal's core stylesheets, so if you
 * remove a declaration from here, the styles may still not be what you want
 * since Drupal's core stylesheets are still styling the element. See the
 * drupal6-reference.css file for a list of all Drupal 5.x core styles.
 *
 * In addition to the style declarations in this file, other Drupal styles that
 * you might want to override or augment are those for:
