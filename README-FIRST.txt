WHERE TO START
--------------

Yay! You opened the correct file first. The first thing that people notice when
they download the Zen theme is that there are A LOT of files -- way more than
other themes.





Full documentation on the Zen theme can be found in Drupal's Handbook:
  http://drupal.org/node/193318

Excellent documentation on Drupal theming can be found in the Theme Guide:
  http://drupal.org/theme-guide


INSTALLATION
------------

 1. Download Zen from http://drupal.org/project/zen

 2. Unpack the downloaded file, take the entire zen folder (which includes the
    README.txt file, a STARTERKIT folder, etc.) and place it in your Drupal
    installation under one of the following locations:
      sites/all/themes
        making it available to the default Drupal site and to all Drupal sites
        in a multi-site configuration
      sites/default/themes
        making it available to only the default Drupal site
      sites/example.com/themes
        making it available to only the example.com site if there is a
        sites/example.com/settings.php configuration file

    For more information about acceptable theme installation directories, read
    the sites/default/default.settings.php file in your Drupal installation.

 3. Log in as an administrator on your Drupal site and go to Administer > Site
    building > Themes (admin/build/themes). You will see the Zen theme there
    with links on how to create your own sub-theme. You can optionally make Zen
    the default theme.


BUILD YOUR OWN SUB-THEME
