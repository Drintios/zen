# Drupal's .info.yml files allow themers to easily specify some of the static
# properties of your theme. Properties such as its name, stylesheets,
# javascripts, and block regions.
#
# Drupal 8 stores a cache of the data in this .info.yml files. If you modify any
# lines in this file, you MUST refresh Drupal 8's cache by simply visiting the
# Appearance page at admin/appearance.



# The name, description and screenshot used for this theme on the Appearance

# This section controls the CSS files for your theme. There are 3 different
# things you can do with a "stylesheets" line:
# - Add a new stylesheet for your theme.
# - Override a module's stylesheet. If the stylesheet you are adding uses the
#   same filename as a stylesheet from a Drupal core or contrib module, your CSS
#   file will be used instead of the module's file.
# - Remove a module's stylesheet. If you specify the name of a Drupal core or
#   contrib module's stylesheets, Drupal will remove that stylesheet if you do
#   NOT include a file with that name with your theme.
#
# stylesheets[MEDIA][]: FILE
#
# The "FILE" is the name of the stylesheet to add/override/remove.
# The "MEDIA" in the first set of brackets is a media type or a media query.
# Typical CSS media types include "all", "screen", "print", and "handheld". A
# typical media query is "screen and (max-width: 320px)".
#
# CSS2.1 media types: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/media.html#media-types

# First we remove any Drupal styling that Zen provides as components.

# This section lists the regions defined in Zen's default page.html.twig and
# maintenance-page.html.twig files. The name before the semi-colon is the machine name of
# the region. The text after the semi-colon is the region's description used on the
# admin/structure/block page.
#
# In the page.html.twig, the contents of the region are output with a
# {{page.MACHINE_NAME}} variable and, in the maintenance-page.html.twig, the region is
# output with a {{MACHINE_NAME}} variable. For example, with these lines in the .info.yml
# file:
#   regions:
#     header_top: Header top
# You'll use this variable in page.html.twig:
#   {{ page.header_top }}
# And you'll use this variable in maintenance-page.html.twig:
#   {{ header_top }}

regions:
  header: Header
  navigation: Navigation bar
  highlighted: Highlighted
  help: Help
  content: Content
  sidebar_first: First sidebar
  sidebar_second : Second sidebar
  footer: Footer
  bottom: Page bottom
  # The page_top and page_bottom regions are hidden, which means they will not
  # show up on the blocks administration page. But they are required in order for
  # the html.tpl.php to work properly, so do not delete them.
  page_top: 'Page top'
  page_bottom: 'Page bottom'
